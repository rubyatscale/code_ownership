  # @param files [Array<String>] An array of file paths to find ownership for.

  # Returns detailed ownership information for a given file path.

  #

  # - :team_name [String] - The name of the owning team
  # - :team_config_yml [String] - Path to the team's configuration YAML file
  # - :reasons [Array<String>] - List of reasons/sources explaining why this team owns the file
  #                               (e.g., "CODEOWNERS pattern: /app/models/**", "Package ownership")

  #       allowing users to understand the ownership assignment logic.

  #       sources to determine ownership, providing complete context about the ownership decision.

  # @see #for_file for a simpler ownership lookup that returns just the team
  # @see CLI#for_file for the command-line interface that uses this method

  # Validates code ownership configuration and optionally corrects issues.
  #
  # This method performs comprehensive validation of the code ownership setup, ensuring:
  # 1. Only one ownership mechanism is defined per file (no conflicts between annotations, packages, or globs)
  # 2. All referenced teams are valid (exist in CodeTeams configuration)
  # 3. All files have ownership (unless explicitly listed in unowned_globs)
  # 4. The .github/CODEOWNERS file is up-to-date and properly formatted
  #
  # When autocorrect is enabled, the method will automatically:
  # - Generate or update the CODEOWNERS file based on current ownership rules
  # - Fix any formatting issues in the CODEOWNERS file
  # - Stage the corrected CODEOWNERS file (unless stage_changes is false)
  #
  # @param autocorrect [Boolean] Whether to automatically fix correctable issues (default: true)
  #                              When true, regenerates and updates the CODEOWNERS file
  #                              When false, only validates without making changes
  #
  # @param stage_changes [Boolean] Whether to stage the CODEOWNERS file after autocorrection (default: true)
  #                                Only applies when autocorrect is true
  #                                When false, changes are written but not staged with git
  #
  # @param files [Array<String>, nil] Ignored. This is a legacy parameter that is no longer used.
  #
  # @return [void]
  #
  # @raise [RuntimeError] Raises an error if validation fails with details about:
  #                       - Files with conflicting ownership definitions
  #                       - References to non-existent teams
  #                       - Files without ownership (not in unowned_globs)
  #                       - CODEOWNERS file inconsistencies
  #
  # @example Basic validation with autocorrection
  #   CodeOwnership.validate!
  #   # Validates all files and auto-corrects/stages CODEOWNERS if needed
  #
  # @example Validation without making changes
  #   CodeOwnership.validate!(autocorrect: false)
  #   # Only checks for issues without updating CODEOWNERS
  #
  # @example Validate and fix but don't stage changes
  #   CodeOwnership.validate!(autocorrect: true, stage_changes: false)
  #   # Fixes CODEOWNERS but doesn't stage it with git
